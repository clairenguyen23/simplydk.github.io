Zero the hero. And, yeah, "_first the worst_". I mean, first isn't always the worst, but I'll get on that another day.

And who’s to say Zero is **NOT** the hero? The world needs Zero.

People can hate him when he appears by himself as a test score. But that’s not his fault. He didn’t take your test. He’s simply there to tell you that you need to study better. And hey! Zero on some clinical exams may actually save your life!

According to Wikipedia, the “[number 0 fulfills a central role in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/0_(number)).” That’s right. That’s how important he is.

I like zero. He’s cool. That’s why my first post will be called **“Zero the Hero.”** Thanks, Mr. Zero.
