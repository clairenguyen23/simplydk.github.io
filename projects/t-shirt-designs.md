For the past four years, I've been helping out at some church retreats, and I usually like to step up to design the t-shirts for the leaders and students. The retreats are called "Metanoia" and "Alive In Spirit", and the shirts usually revolve around those two themes.
This is where I really tested my skills with GIMP and Inkscape! Since I was still learning, I got a lot of help from a good friend. I'm also currently working on the design for the retreat in 2017, so stayed tuned **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/tshirts/AIS-2017)**! This time around, I'll be doing all of the work, so it'll be a very different experience, and one that will really show how much I've learned.

Here are some of the designs I was a part of:

**Metanoia 2013:**

**Metanoia 2014:**

Don't forget to follow the process on the new shirt for the upcoming retreat **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/tshirts/AIS-2017)**!
