During my last quarter at UCI, I decided to take a Game Development Project Class, even though I've never really considered doing anything related to games. While I was growing up, my parents didn't let me play video games (and many other things computer science-related) so I would sneak around and play at my friends' or play PC games in the computer lab at school. But since I never really was able to get into games like my friends could, doing anything related to making games was usually last on my list of things to do. I mostly decided to try this class out because my friend pushed me to do it and because there weren't any other classes that peaked my interest.

By the end of the quarter, I realized it was worth it.

It wasn't as simple as "make a game, call it a day" kind of project; that was I thought was all this class was going to be. Instead, this class went past just making a game, and explored what it's like make a game, document it and market it -- sort of like a real gaming company, which means I worked in a group to do all of this. So for ten weeks, we created a classic comedy RPG along with a 20-page documentation and a company website.

I was mainly in charge of designing the entire world map using Tiled, which ended up being 35 individual maps, 30x30 tiles in size each. Check it out below!

I was also in charge of designing the website that would go with our company. You can go ahead and visit it at **[wowgames.github.io](http://wowgames.github.io){:target="_blank"}**!

All in all, my last ten weeks at UCI were well-spent. I was on a really good team, and the tasks I took on were things I enjoyed working on.
