Hey guys! So I'm part of the T-shirt committee this year again for the Alive In Spirit retreat in January 2017. I'm working with a few other talented gals to pool ideas together and make this year's shirt awesome!

This year, the shirt is supposed to coincide with the theme "prayer". It's a pretty abstract theme, but we managed to come up with some really good designs so far that implement "prayer" well. Here are some of the ideas so far:

![Sketches 1](/images/metanoia2017_sketches1.jpg "Sketches #1")
![Sketches 2](/images/metanoia2017_sketches2.jpg "Sketches #2")
![Sketches 3](/images/metanoia2017_sketches3.jpg "Sketches #3")

Our silly sketches are chicken scratches so far, but I'll update this more when we have a finalized idea!

We have a deadline: December 11th, 2016. It doesn't seem like it's any time soon, but in the next four weeks, we'll have this ready.

Stayed tuned!

#### Update 1

Here are the finalized sketches of the design we want on the front and back of the shirt:

**Front:**

**Back:**
![Back Sketch](/images/ais_back_sketch.jpg "Back Sketch")

I'll be back with these sketches converted into svg format soon!

#### Update 2

Our shirt is done! Here it is:

I used a combination of GIMP and Inkscape to get everything together. I might have mentioned this before, but I used to use a combination of Word and Paint to design stuff a long time ago since I didn't know that more advanced programs existed. Ever since I discovered these programs a few years ago, I haven't gone back to my old, caveman days, and implementing all of this without any help was a huge step forward for me.

I also want to thank Emily Nguyen and Ngan Dinh and their beautiful hand drawn sketches of the finalized design! (Front: Ngan, Back: Emily) Working with them to put together design ideas was more fun than work. We did it!
