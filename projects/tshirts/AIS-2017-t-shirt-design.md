Hey guys! So I'm part of the T-shirt committee this year again for the Alive In Spirit retreat in January 2017. I'm working with a few other talented gals to pool ideas together and make this year's shirt awesome!

This year, the shirt is supposed to coincide with the theme, which is "prayer". It's a pretty abstract theme, but we managed to come up with some really good designs so far that implement "prayer" really well. Here are some of the ideas so far:

![Sketches 1](/images/metanoia2017_sketches1.jpg "Sketches #1")
![Sketches 2](/images/metanoia2017_sketches2.jpg "Sketches #2")
![Sketches 3](/images/metanoia2017_sketches3.jpg "Sketches #3")

Our silly sketches are chicken scratches so far, but I'll update this more when we have a finalized idea!

We have a deadline: December 11th, 2016. It doesn't seem like it's near, but in the next four weeks, we'll have this ready.
Stayed tuned! I'll be putting the tree-birds design into Inkscape as soon as I can!

(Still in development)
