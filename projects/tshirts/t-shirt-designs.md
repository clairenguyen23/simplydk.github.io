For the past four years, I've been helping out at some church retreats, and I usually like to step up to design the t-shirts for the participants. The retreats are called "Metanoia" and "Alive In Spirit", and the shirts usually revolve around those two themes.

This is where I really tested my skills with GIMP and Inkscape! Since I was still learning, I got a lot of help from a good friend.

I recently worked on the design for the a retreat in January 2017, so read about the progress **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/t-shirt-designs/AIS-2017)**! This time around, I did all of the work turning the design into svg format without any help, so it was a very different experience that showed how much I've learned.

Here are some of the designs I was a part of:

**Metanoia 2013:**
