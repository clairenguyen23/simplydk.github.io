Over the past few years, I've enjoyed creating different things as well as trying out new stuff. Some of them are physical creations, things I made to sell, display, gift, etc (check out my **[store]({{ site.baseurl }}/store/)**[still in development] and **[tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials/)**[still in development] to see some of my creations!) Others are things I've dabbled in by using software to design. One funny thing I always tell people is that when I was a lot younger, I didn't know what PhotoShop was, but the way I edited images and designed my own drawings was to use a combination of Microsoft Word and Paint. That was how I was able to utilize the concept of layers. It took a long time every time, but it worked for younger me.

Years later, I found my way to PhotoShop and Illustrator. However, I didn't have enough money then to buy those two softwares, so I decided to try out GIMP and Inkscape. Those two softwares completely changed my life, especially the life I had using just Word and Paint. I could do so many more stuff that I labored doing with my caveman methods, as well as other things that I would never dream being able to do. These two have immensely helped with many projects, especially my latest ones.

For one, I've been volunteering to design the T-shirts for retreats I've helped out with over the past 4 years. Utilizing the two softwares, I've helped the designing process from taking a drawing and converting to a vector image, as well as created my own design from start to finish. You can take a look at some of them **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/tshirts/)**. Currently, I'm working on another design for an event in January, and you can follow the process **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/tshirts/AIS-2017)**. I think it's going to be the best one yet!

Recently, I picked up a new skill: making tilemaps! Boy oh boy, that was some good fun. In total, I made 35 total maps, each 32x32. You can read about it **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/tilemap/)**. That was something I always thought was one of the coolest things in a game whenever I played games, especially with old-school pixelated tilemaps. The tilemap was made for a game I'm currently making with my group in a game development class. One other requirement we also needed was to create a website for the game, so I decided to step up for that as well. You can check it out **[here](http://wowgames.github.io/)**.

And, of course, in and of itself, this website is one of my projects. And I gotta say, it's been the most fun and most rewarding project I've had so far. I used a lot of my skills, as well as picked up a lot of new ones, to put together this site, and I hope that once I get this out into the real world, people will also be able to see how much fun I had putting all of this together. To be honest, I never would have thought I'd ever attempt to make my own website, let alone buy my own domain and have one actually up and running _ON THE WORLD WIDE WEB_; it really amazes me how far I've gone. When I first tried a couple years ago, it did not look as nice as this; I messed up pretty badly and abandoned the project for about a year. I only picked this up again about half a year ago to try again, and I'm pretty glad I did, because here it is! You can read more about it **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/the-quiet-tofu-project/)**.
