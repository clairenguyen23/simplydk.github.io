Cranes 109-128

Paper & Setting: random white paper cranes scattered amongst all the Yu-Gi-Oh cards I have

Long, lingering thoughts? Yes and no.

Something good, really good, happened...BUT I want to make sure things are really happening before I can say anything.

On the other hand, I discovered a new game on the Google Play store called Duel Links. It's basically an app where you can simulate Yu-Gi-Oh duels against NPCs (with increasingly smart AIs) and real people. It's pretty good, except it's more similar to the anime, which means that the duels are quicker and not as exciting. Instead of 8000 Life Points, you only get 4000. Instead of 5 Monster Zones and 5 Spell and Trap Zones, you only get 3 of each. The cards that you get from the virtual booster packs are not that good, so the decks that you try to put together aren't as great as the ones you can make in real life. All in all, it's a satisfying app to relive Yu-Gi-Oh memories, but after a while, I found myself yearning for real world duels with physical cards and people; the environment is a lot more intense and exciting...which was the reason why I busted out my Yu-Gi-Oh cards. I wanted to try to make another deck, different from my already-awesome Cure-Burn Deck (very few people have beat me with that deck). I'm seriously nerding out right now...but this game is just so good!
