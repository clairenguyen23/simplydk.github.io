Cranes 41-60

Paper & Setting: journal paper cranes, folded while waiting to be called during jury duty; picture taken outside when the rain let up a bit

Long, lingering thoughts? Nah, relatively quiet week.

During this week, I had to come in for jury duty again (I was deferred because last year I was still in school). For the second time, I was called in, but for the first time, I actually served on a case as an alternate juror; thankfully, I was excused early to go to an interview on Monday (so so nerve-racking, but I'll leave that for next week).

That week, it started raining a lot, especially nearing the weekend. But during a small respite in the storm, I went out and snapped a couple pictures and had fun with some of the settings on my camera. Look out for that box (though not guaranteed it will always be there) in other crane pictures! It holds mysterious things. :P
