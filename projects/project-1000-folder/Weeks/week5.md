Cranes 89-108

Paper & Setting: blue, purple, and black origami paper with a 300-piece jigsaw puzzle

Long, lingering thoughts? Not as much this week.

It's been pretty quiet after last week. I went to Michael's and found some jigsaw puzzles so I decided to try it out again. This really made me nostalgic; I used to like doing these when I was a kid. Funny how a bunch of small little pieces could so easily frustrate me, but the feeling of accomplishment was worth it, especially after putting together a 500-piece one. I realized doing jigsaw puzzles can be both a good thing and bad thing for people with OCD. Bad because if you don't finish it, then it's irritating, but good popping in each piece that fits perfectly as well as the end result. Though, again, bad because if you lose any pieces, that would be even more irritating, so I gotta be careful!
