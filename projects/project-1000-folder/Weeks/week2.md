So this week was supposed to be the first week of winter quarter at UCI, and I would be back there...had I not been finished yet. It's a little weird seeing and hearing everyone complain about going back while I was going to stay home, but in all honesty, I'm really enjoying the heck out of this long-awaited break. Just like the picture I took, I stayed in all week finally having time to catch up on my Korean dramas (the one in the picture was one I had just finished called Oh My Geum Bi) and things I haven't had time to do for a long while.

Not having to brave traffic and fight for parking spaces has been really nice, especially when classes are back in session. I haven't had an actual proper break in which I didn't have to have to think about how "school is going to start again in __ weeks or __ days, grumble grumble", for a long time...maybe 2 years now? Every summer since my third year, I've always had classes, which means I haven't had a summer break for about 2-3 years now. This was all a means to catch up with everyone in the Computer Science major, with not just people who came into UCI originally as a CS major, but also with the many people who grew up with convenient access to a computer in their home and freedom to explore computers and programming when they were younger. To be honest, I had never done any coding until I switched out of Biology, became Undeclared, and went into my first class in programming, ICS 31; that was when I felt myself becoming interested and started asking, "what else is there about computers that I don't know yet?" and started nudging my way into Computer Science.

My parents believed that computers and the internet were bad and especially dangerous for me, their daughter. They believed that these kinds of things were for boys like my older brother. I actually didn't have my own email until 10th or 11th grade, and that was with a lot of trepidation from my parents, although it wasn't long after when they decided emails were actually not bad, and got one for themselves.

I started at UCI as a Biology major to make my parents happy. But I wasn't happy. Biology wasn't something I really had a passion in, and being in a medical career wasn't something I could see myself in. Becoming a doctor was something I kept trying to pretend to aspire to be, and I kept lying to myself for many years and psyching myself up to be more excited about this future. I even told myself that if I just had to be a doctor, I could just be a veterinarian, because I might as well enjoy it while I can.

Even then, my parents told me they didn't like that because the job isn't lucrative and as reputable as other kinds of doctors. Basically, they wanted me to be a doctor that made a lot of money, one that they can show off to everyone as their daughter who is a very successful doctor (because apparently, veterinarians are not as successful as other kinds of doctors).

But I wasn't happy with that, and I guess my way of making sure they actually listen, instead of brushing it off, was going ahead and changing out of Biology, and into Computer Science, one major they really didn't want me to pursue. I'm definitely not saying CS is my true life dream and passion, because there is so much about it that I still want to learn about, and because there are still other things out there that I love doing as well. But I like to look at this as one step closer to taking control of my life instead of letting them decide for me.
