It's always hard for me to start things because I never know where to begin. So how did I start this reboot then? (As for why, read about it **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/project-1000-reboot/about-project-1000)**!) Well, I saw some fast food coupons lying around and was tearing some out, ones that I liked. McDonald's buy a Big Mac and get one free? Heck yes!

But then I realized, these coupons were one of the biggest reasons that made it easier for me to decide to choose fast food over...not fast food. So I thought, why don't I just use these coupons to make the first cranes for my reboot of Project 1000 instead of using them to "make it cheaper for me to obtain fast food"? This way, I not only destroy one reason to eat unhealthy, but I also get free paper to make my cranes! So upon closer inspection in my photo, you can see that I've used my McDonald's, Del Taco, Burger King, and Subway coupons for my first cranes.

So then my next mission was, well, what kind of photo do I wanna take with these cranes? Where? With what? Maybe a shot with the cranes sitting on the dashboard of my car while I'm parked in front of McDonald's? That way, I would be expressing my longing for their McDoubles. I still wasn't sure until I was in the middle of a church retreat that I was helping out with, which was during the first 3-day weekend of this year. That was where I wanted to take a picture of my first week, but I didn't have my cranes with me, so I opted for the day after the retreat ended when I was resting at home while it was raining after the long weekend. The shirt is the one I helped design for this year's retreat (you can read more about it **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/t-shirt-designs/AIS-2017)**) and so far, it's been the best I've worked on.

Now, the first week of 2017 is over. As much as new years are usually more exciting, mine has been very mellow and quiet as the holidays ended. It's actually the first time, since I was probably 4 years old when I started pre-school, that I'm not in school. It's a strange feeling. Around this time of year, I would be getting ready to go back to UCI for my winter quarter, but I'm not. Instead, I'm looking for jobs and, instead of stressing about classes, I'm stressing about finding a job. Hooray, adult life!

I think this year marks the year I start a new phase of my life, and I think the only way to start is to dive in.

So, along with the hunt for jobs, for each of the next 51 weeks, my tasks for this project are to:

* find paper to fold a handful of cranes (about 19-20)
* FOLD those cranes (man, that takes a while!)
* find a place to take the picture of the cranes, or things to take a picture with the cranes, or both
* write about it!

This may be a rough start but I promise it'll get better. Stay tuned!
