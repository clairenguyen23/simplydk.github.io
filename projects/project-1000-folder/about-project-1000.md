One thousand cranes?

Yep! In 2011 in my junior and senior year in high school, I decided to try something out:

Every day, I would fold a few cranes and take a photo of them with something or some place unique. By the end of the year, I would have a total of a thousand cranes.

An old legend in Japan says that whoever folds a thousand cranes would be granted a wish. Common wishes included longevity or having good health or recovery, or just eternal good luck. During World War II, a Japanese girl named Sadako Sasaki was affected by the Hiroshima bombing as a baby and developed leukemia. While she spent a lot of her time in the hospital, she started folding cranes having heard about this legend so that she might be granted the wish of recovery from her illness. Although she couldn't reach a thousand before she died, her classmates decided to finish for her to honor her memory.

I wasn't quite sure what my end goal for the project was, but I wanted to have fun with it and see what happens. By the time the end of the year came around, there wasn't exactly a particular wish I had in mind; the only thing that really stayed with me was how I didn't give up halfway, even though it felt dry at certain times. I had somehow made it to 12th grade, but more importantly, I made it through one of the most difficult years of my life at that time.

This year, 2017, I wanted to try a reboot and start the project over again. It's been 5 years since I made my last crane, and my life is a lot more different now. I just graduated a month ago (Class of 2016!) so I want to see where my life takes me during this year. However, just like the first time I tried this, I'm not sure what my end goal is, but I do know I want to incorporate more of my life and events this year. I'm not sure where this will take me, but it's getting me excited just writing about it!

I used to use a regular digital camera or just my old phone's camera, but this time around, I have my own DSLR so I'll both be practicing my photography skills as well as be able to take better shots. I will also, instead of a few cranes every day which amounts to over 300 photos, be making a handful of cranes every week and end with just 52 photos by the end of the year.

Well, wish me luck! Check it out **[here]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/project-1000/project-1000-reboot/)**!
