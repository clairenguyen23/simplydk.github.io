Hi, I'm **DK**, simply DK, and I recently graduated from University of California, Irvine in Fall 2016 with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Class of 2016, whoohoo!

I've been trying to get my own website up for a couple years now, but schoolwork was always the higher priority.
During my last quarter, I decided to give this another chance and have at it again.

This is what I've done so far, and of course, it's definitely far from finished. _Let me know what you think!_
