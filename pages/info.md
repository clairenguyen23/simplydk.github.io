I'm **DK**, simply DK, and I am currently studying Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine.
When I say **currently** I mean that I've been there for four years, but I'm about to graduate in two months.
_Can you believe that?_ Because I can't.

I've been trying to get my own website up for a couple years now, but schoolwork was always the higher priority.
Now that it's my last quarter, I decided to give this another chance.

This is what I've done so far, and of course it's definitely far from finished. _Let me know what you think!_
