**And neither is the quiet tofu, but maybe that's something we can talk about!**

Wanna talk to me? Or maybe you wanna just send a quick hello!  
Either way, you can use the contact form below:

<form method="POST" action="http://formspree.io/dkknguyen23@gmail.com">
  <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Your email">
  <textarea name="message" placeholder="Your message"></textarea>
  <div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="6Ld6YwkUAAAAAI-JbUhowhTEU0QMpgIzhFGn6s3J"></div>
  <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>
<script src='https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api.js'></script>

My inbox is ready! Send away! :D
