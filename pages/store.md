**See some things in my store that I haven't made a tutorial for? Feel free to _[request tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)_ and I might just hop on it!**

One thing you gotta know about me: I love to make things.

But I've noticed over the years since middle school that some of the stuff I've made are actually cool, and people see that, too. In high school, I decided to try to sell some of my stuff on eBay, and I made a little lunch money profit for a month. But that wasn't much so I didn't try again...until now!

I currently don't have anything in here yet, but I'll be putting up stuff as soon as I can. My items will be put in the Etsy store, and I'll be connecting to it here. Stay tuned!
