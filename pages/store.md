**See some things in my store that I haven't made a tutorial for? Feel free to _[request tutorials]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/)_ and I might just hop on it!**

I've noticed over the years since middle school that some of the stuff I've made are actually cool, and people have told me that, too. In high school, I decided to try to sell some of my stuff on eBay, and I made a little lunch money profit for a couple months. But that wasn't much so I didn't try again (and instead focused more on school)...until now!

I currently don't have anything in here yet, but I'll be putting up stuff as soon as I can. My items will be put in the Etsy store, and I'll be connecting to it here. Stay tuned!
